#### This assumes that you already know how to write basic code, i.e. you know how to create at least an array, a function, a struct in any language. We would be using C++ for this tutorial.

The goal of this week is to learn basics of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), understand their importance and application in software development, learn about standard data structures available in STL (Standard Template Library) and implement them yourself from scratch. 

OOPs is asked by 99% of the companies in their interviews and it is implicitly assumed that you would know it, many of you would have used OOPs while programming without even realizing that.
The rest of the content in this tutorial has been picked up from **Google FTE, Expedia, LinkedIn, Commvault, Amazon, Morgan Stanley, Optum (UHG), Samsung, Envestnet Yodlee** interviews or coding round held this year. The actual list is of course way bigger.

Let's start!

## Part 1: OOPs

1. What is Object Oriented Programming and why is it necessary?

2. OOPs in C++

You are good to go for now!

## Part 2: Implement basic DS from scratch

Goal is to implement basic data structures like vector (dynamic array), linked list, stack & queue using linked list, binary tree, binary search tree, trie, set, map, hashmap (unordered_set and unordered_map), binary heap from scratch. 
You should be using OOPs concepts to implement them. Think of the inbuilt-funtions STL has for each of these data structures (for example push(), pop(), find(), insert(), erase(), size(), empty() etc.) and implement them.
Video tutorials for these would be shared after 3 days - this file would be updated. Till then, you are encouraged to try it out yourself. 

PS: Graphs would be covered separately. 

### Questions to take care of while following up with this guide:

1. What was your project about? Why did you choose this project? What innovation did you bring to the project?
2. What problems did you face while doing this project? How did you tackle them?
3. What things do you believe you could have done better?
4. What did you learn from the project? 
5. What tech stack was used in the project? Why did you use this particular tool and why not something else, what advantage does it give?
6. Was it a team project? If yes, were there any moments you and your teammates had a conflict of opinion? (Likely expected answer is yes). If so, How did you solve those conflicts?

Don't hesitate to ask for help from your seniors, or just reply back to the mail in which this tutorial was sent.
