## Introduction
A lot of problems require knowledge of Number Theory and Discrete mathematics. Hence it becomes important to be well versed with such topics before hand as many problems do include methods such as prime factorisation, prime number tests, count of divisors etc as subroutines.

Can you solve this problem? [Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TDPRIMES/)

If not, you probably need to know how to find a lot of primes more faster.
