Coding interviews are tough. But fortunately, there's a tried and proven method to get better at them. With a combination of studying, practicing questions and doing mock interviews, getting that dream job can become a reality.

1. Study CS fundamentals
2. Practice solving algorithm questions
3. Internalize the Do's and Don'ts of interviews
4. Practice doing mock interviews
5. Know the placement procedure for the company you are applying and interview successfully to get the job

## Know the language

[This resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tGSeFzLYHqavsU7EVcC_core3MSsipGn9sEgyeLNLik/edit?usp=sharing) is targeted for the the extreme beginners. 
After understanding the syntax of language, you should atleast solve 30-40 questions from [a2oj](https://www.a2oj.com/Ladder5.html) just to get better at problem solving whenever stuck you can refer to editorials.

* This is majorly about getting hang of problem solving skills and using the basic mathematics you previously know. If you are comfortable with any language(C, C++, Java, Python), you can skip this.


## Common data structures and algorithms to prepare for interviews:

Each topic contains some resources and problems to understand the topic. Try to solve problems on your own at first. You might need to refer solution if you are doing it first time. After completing a topic from here, do practice some questions from leetcode(you can sort questions on basis of tags and difficulty) and proceed to next topic if you are confident.(Don't skip any topic).
